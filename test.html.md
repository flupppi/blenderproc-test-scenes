# BlenderProc Test Scenes


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Sadly it is not possible to develop a blenderproc pipeline in a notebook
fully. Blenderproc needs to execute in a BlenderInternal python
interpreter.

We can still develop some functionality in notebooks, but only things
that can be run without requiring to import the blenderproc libraries.

## Datasets

BlenderProc provides easy access to many datasets and freely available
assets that can be used for testing using the [blenderproc
download](https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc/blob/main/docs/tutorials/loader.md)
command.

Once you download these assets to your system they can be implemented
using different loaders that convert the dataset specific formats into
`MeshObject` instances.

e.g.: `objs = bproc.loader.load_obj("mymesh.obj")`

## Manipulating objects

Once loaded objects can be manipulated using built in functions.
e.g.Â changing the location, rotation, full pose matrix or transformation
matrix.

## Custom properties

Assigning custom properties might be interesting for semantic
segmentation this can be done with the commands
`obj.set_cp("my_prop", 42)` or `obj.get_cp("my_prop")`
