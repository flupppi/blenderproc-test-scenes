    "Sadly it is not possible to develop a blenderproc pipeline in a notebook fully. Blenderproc needs to execute in a BlenderInternal python interpreter. \n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "BlenderProc provides easy access to many datasets and freely available assets that can be used for testing using the [blenderproc download](https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc/blob/main/docs/tutorials/loader.md) command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you download these assets to your system they can be implemented using different loaders that convert the dataset specific formats into `MeshObject` instances.\n",

    "e.g.: `objs = bproc.loader.load_obj(\"mymesh.obj\")`\n",

    "## Manipulating objects\n",

    "Once loaded objects can be manipulated using built in functions.\n",
    "e.g. changing the location, rotation, full pose matrix or transformation matrix.\n",

    "## Custom properties\n",
    "Assigning custom properties might be interesting for semantic segmentation this can be done with the commands `obj.set_cp(\"my_prop\", 42)` or `obj.get_cp(\"my_prop\")`\n"
